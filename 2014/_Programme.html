            <p>
                We, ourselves young students, are taking the lead in educational innovation by creating an educational project within the conference on Education. The mission of this educational project is to create a medium of exchange for educational change. Workshop Day will be a day of conference meetings and workshops for discussions on education and skills training, which are designed and dedicated to high-flying students from the Baltic States and the United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that good questions outrank easy answers. We want to empower the students so that they can give answers by representing their views and coming up with solutions that will re-envision and reinvigorate Education in the Baltics. In addition, we will prepare them for asking demanding questions by providing training through informational, leadership, debate and public speaking workshops and discussions, which will enable them to question the answers represented by the speakers on the second conference day. In doing this and representing the ideas of the youth on the second day panel discussions we want to encourage everyone to always think of themselves as students, who continuously learn and go forward. This October we gather young minds and acclaimed experts in Cambridge to encourage us all not limit ourselves to our individual learning and ideas, for each of us were born in a different time and place. Instead, <i>we aspire to engender a medium where students, thinkers, artists, innovators, entrepreneurs, educators, politicians connect, collide and create</i>.
