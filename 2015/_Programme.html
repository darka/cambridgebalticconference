Could development of transferable knowledge and skills be the key to success in education and work also in the Baltics? How and when this is to be achieved?

                        The panel on higher education will discuss the ideal practices in higher education in both the Baltic countries and the UK. Speakers will touch upon issues such as practical versus theoretical approaches to learning, the role of extracurricular activities, students' work experience and international student exchanges.

                        From primary to higher education, traditional teaching methods are being challenged both globally and within Baltic countries and are shaping a new way of building knowledge and teaching the youth of today and tomorrow. Where is the future of education moving, as well as where should it be moving, in both the level of Baltic states and the rest of the world?
